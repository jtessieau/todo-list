# TODO LIST

Simple todo list in js and node.

## Installation

The front is write in HTML + Javascript. But I choose to use Parcel to split the project in multiple files and use SCSS.
Parcel will handle the compilation of all the files into an usable web application.
So you will need to install some dependencies.

### List of dependencies

#### For development

- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io)
- [eslint](https://eslint.org)

#### For application

- [Express](https://expressjs.com)
- [Cors](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cors.html)

### Install the dependencies

Use npm or yarn to install all the needed modules.

```node
npm install
```

## Usage

I add source and scripts in package.json files so you can use simple commande to start the project.

This commande will start a development server for backend and frontend to work on.

```node
npm run dev
```
